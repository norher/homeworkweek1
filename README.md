HTML and CSS Basics

This is a refactoring homework. 

We were given a repository and we were assigned to make it look consice and accessible by adding semantic HTML sections. 

I added semantic html elements but I also consolidated css elements. 

This individual application is the homepage to Horiseon.

It gives detailed information about what Horiseon does in the realm of Search Engine Optimization.

In the header we have a nav tag with links that take you to the dedicated articles that those links refer to. 

The links are Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Mangagement, and Social Media Marketing. Each one has an article referenced to it in the main part of our application. 

Each article or section has a detailed description of the topic it explains along with an image next to it.

The aside section has quick, marketable, sell point to intrigue whoever is visiting this application. 

The aside section has more information on topics like Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management. 

It ends with a footer that this code was made with love. 

At any one point the user can click on the links in the nav section to access the detailed articles about that topic.
